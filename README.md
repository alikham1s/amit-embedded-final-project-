# amit-embedded-final-project-
made by Ali Khamis
this code was made for amit embedded systems graduation project that does the following:
A Robotic car that uses an ultrasonic sensor to determine which way it has to go judging by the distance.
the ultra sonic sensor is set on a servo motor that helps move sensor left and right.
there is an included lcd screen that shows the read distance from the ultrasonic sensor every time it works.
motor drivers have been optimized and connect the board to the power supply to the motors.
